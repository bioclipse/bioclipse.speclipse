	<intro>
		<description>
			This cheat sheet tells you about things you can do with spectra in Bioclipse. 
			Note that each step in this cheat sheet is an independent task, so there is no order and steps do not depend on each other.

	<item title="Step 0: Prerequisites">
		<description>
 			You need the Speclipse feature installed for this (which you have if you read this and installed via the update site).  If you don't have any spectrum files, 
 			there's a good idea to create a new Speclipse Sample Data Project before starting with this cheat sheet. This is done by choosing <b>File > Newâ€¦ > Data >
 			Speclipse Sample Data Project</b>.

       title="Step 1: Analyze spectra">
		<description>
			The spectrum editor shows spectrum files in any of the allowed formats (see help via ? on top of this section for details). By default, spectrum files 
			will open in it. If they do not, right click the file and choose <b> Open with > Spectrum Editor </b>. The editor gives you an insight 
			into the content of the file. See the help for explanations. If you want to compare several spectra, you can use the 
			Compare Spectra view. Open it with the link below and choose as many peak spectra files as you like in the navigator (hold Ctrl). They 
			will be shown in the same scale (it only makes sense to compare spectra of the same type, e. g. 1H-NMR). Files not 
			containing a peak spectrum will be ignored.

       title="Step 2: Perform a peak picking">
		<description>
			When a file is open in the spectrum editor, you can perform a peak picking via the "Pick peaks" icon in the toolbar.

       title="Step 3: Creating a new (peak) spectrum">
		<description>
			You can create a new spectrum in Speclipe. In practice, this is restricted to peak spectra since you need to enter 
			the data yourself. See help via ? on top of this section for details.

       title="Step 5: Find out which structure might be behind an NMR spectrum">
		<description>
			If you have a peak-picked NMR spectrum, you can try to find out what structure was recorded via searching in 
			NMRShiftDB. Right click on your spectrum in the navigator and choose <b>Spectrum Search in NMRShiftDB..."</b>. For 
			details, click ? on top of this section.

       title="Step 6: Get the NMR spectrum for a structure">
		<description>
			If you want to know what the NMR spectrum of a structure would look like, there are two options: Firstly you can 
			search NMRShiftDB for it. Right-click your structure in the navigator and choose <b>Download NMR spectra for this molecule...</b>. This 
			will give you a measured, accurate spectrum given it is in NMRShiftDB. If not, you have the second option of predicting the spectrum 
			via <b>Spectrum Prediction > NMR from NMRShiftDB</b>. This will give you a result in any case. In most cases this will closely match the 
			real spectrum, but in rare cases (e. g. exotic elements in your structure) the results can be inaccurate.
